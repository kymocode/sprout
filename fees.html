            <p class="lead">NDIS:</p><p>Self-managed and plan managed NDIS participants are welcome. Adult and Paediatric Services are provided. Please have your NDIS plan available at the time of consultation and ensure that dietetic services can be covered by your plan. If you attend an appointment and your plan cannot cover the appointment you will be required to pay the appointment fee in full.</p>

            <p>You may be eligible to have some, or all your consultation fees covered by your aged care package. Speak with your provider. </p>

            <p>Home visits are only offered to those clients who are unable to attend clinic in person and not able to utilise telehealth services. Travel is billed at $1/km from 15 Butterworth Lane, Taree.</p>

            <p class="lead">Late Arrivals:
            <p>Arriving late for your appointment may affect the length of your consultation. Please note that your service will end on time to avoid delaying the next client. </p>

            <p class="lead">Session Times:</p><p>Occaisonally the appointment before you may run overtime. This will not impact the length of your session, and the same courtesy will be applied to you if it is required. We kindly ask that you are patient and understand that health assessments can sometimes be complex and take longer than anticipated</p>

            <p class="lead">Payment:

            <p class="lead">Cancellations:
            <p>I understand that life can be unpredictable, and sometimes plans need to change. If you need to cancel or reschedule your appointment, please provide at least 24 hours’ notice so I can offer that time to someone else who may be waiting. You will be sent and SMS reminder for your appointment 48hours before your scheduled appointment to help you plan. For cancellations made with less than 24 hours’ notice, 50% of the consultation fee will be charged. This policy helps cover the time reserved for you and ensures the sustainability of the practice. </p>
            
            <p class="lead">Missed Appointments</p><p>I understand that emergencies and unexpected events can happen. However, if no notice is given and an appointment is missed, the full consultation fee will be charged. This allows me to manage time effectively and continue offering care to others in need.</p>
            <p>Thank you for your understanding and respect for both our time.</p>
