    <h1>Im glad you're here</h1>
    <p>I’ve spent 15 years practicing as a clinical dietitian, working with clients one on one and in group settings to meet their nutrition and health needs. I’ve had the privilege of working with countless adults and children, having practiced locally in the public health service as well as a large tertiary hospital in Sydney. I’ve met some inspiring people along the way and look forward to hearing your story.</p>
    <p>I also know what it feels like to sit on the other side of the consulting table and know that a good experience with a health professional, where you feel seen and heard, can be make or break for your healing and progress. I want to be that person for you, who validates your experience, understands your situation, and walks hand in hand with you towards better health.</p>
    <p>I’m passionate about prevention and the research is clear. Working towards a balanced, healthy diet, whatever that looks like for you, not only reduces your risk of many health complications, but it can improve your physical and mental wellbeing long into the future. And if you are unfortunately experiencing health concerns, the good news is many nutrition related health problems can be reduced or even reversed with a commitment to dietary change. Eating well translates to living well, and I’m here to help you live the best version of your life you can, with small, sustainable strategies you can continue into the long term. No fads, just plenty of good food to nourish your gut, your mind and your body.</p>

    <p>I’ve worked with people from all walks and stages of life, from new parents with growing babies to individuals living well into their 90s.As a parent myself,I know the hustle well. Kids are fussy and there never seems to be enough hours in the day. We’ll work together with care and empathy, knowing that no two children are the same and that life is busy, beautiful and messy.</p>
    <p>If you’re here for yourself, then I’m here for you. I’ve worked extensively with the adult population and have a diverse skillset, supporting people with conditions of the heart, lungs, liver, kidneys and digestive system. I’ve helped people prepare for and recover from major surgery and supported people undergoing cancer treatment therapies. If you take some or all of your nutrition through a feeding tube, I am able to support you with your enteral feeding plan.</p>
